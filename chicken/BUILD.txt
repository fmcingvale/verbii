Tested with chicken-5.3.0

1. Extract chicken source here.

2. mkdir local-chicken

2. cd chicken-*

3. make PREFIX=/mnt/c/frank/src/verbii/chicken/local-chicken

4. make PREFIX=/mnt/c/frank/src/verbii/chicken/local-chicken install

NOTE: The chicken compiler (csc) has the same name as the C# compiler, so
I build it here to avoid nameclash with existing builds.

5. ./local-chicken/bin/chicken-install coops
./local-chicken/bin/chicken-install srfi-13
