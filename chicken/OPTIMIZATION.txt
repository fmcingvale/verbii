Before starting any chicken optimization (commit [1796e19])

(NOTE: makediffs was run after EACH run below to ensure no new errors.)

time ./regression.sh, interpreted: 104 seconds
time, compiled (with -O3): 54 seconds

For baseline comparison with other ports:
	* Python:	5.7 seconds
	* Lua:		5.6 seconds
	* C#: 		2.8 seconds
	* C++: 		1.7 seconds (non-optimized)
	* C++:		0.8 seconds (-O3)

===============
Added (declare (declare (standard-bindings)) to all .scm files.
Result: No difference in times.

===============
Added (declare (extended-bindings)) [in addition to above].
Result: No difference in times.

===============
Changed: memset, memget, pop, push from (define-method) to (define)
Result: No difference in times.

===============
Changed: pop-typed-objs - use a list for argtypes instead of a string.

improved times:

interpreted: 83 seconds (from 104)
compiled: 40 seconds (from 54)

=> so ... it appears that string-related stuff is really slow.
