\ Simple chess engine - purely for fun, not practicality :-) Very simple & slow design.
\ Also this is a semi-real app so makes a better excercise for programming in verbii
\ versus the shorter demos. Working on this has also inspired many other language features
\ and changes.
\
\ This module just pulls in all the other modules.
