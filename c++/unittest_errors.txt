( -- this is split off from unittest_core since it was -- )
( -- getting hard to read the results with a mix of errors -- )
( -- and non-errors -- also now I could add a command line option -- )
( -- along with -test to say stop on errors for the non-error cases -- )
		
( -- another benefit is that the non-error testcases can be run -- )
( -- without -test and can run to completion -- )

( -- side note: multiline comments are fine normally, they just have to be single line in -- )
( -- -test mode since it processes one line at a time so it can restart on errors -- )
