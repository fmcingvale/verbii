Global TODO

* Add string type

* After strings added, add 'error' to cause program exit with message
	* change string parser to look for " at start/end of words, instead of as
	separate words

* After above, make expect-f exit test when %diff too large

* More expect-* things to further automate unittests

* More error checking of input types in library/tests/demos

* 63-bit integers
	* or ... maybe 52 since some host languages use floats for ints??

* change parser to read ( ... ) as a single unit before it gets to interpreter

* add lists
	* this will enable things like closures where a list can be bound to lambda
	and add an 'apply' that's like call except it pushes the bound list first

* add bit level operations -- limit to 32 bits
	* add random number generator (pcg32)

* improve exp by reducing x like dividing by 100,1000,1e6,etc. and adjusting
  at end since values for powers of 10 can be in a table (exp algorithm seems
  to have trouble with larger values)
