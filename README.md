Core ideas:
# Simple - any languages features that become un-simple are out.
# Small & easy to port - ability to run on many host languages for fun/comparison purposes.
# Interpreted-only - no parsing, compiling, etc. Run directly from source text.

Features:
# Integers are the only data type.
# However, you can print string constants.
