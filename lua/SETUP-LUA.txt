I had to self-build Lua 5.4.x for Ubuntu ...

1. Download and build lua source
2. Install luarocks per: https://luarocks.org/#quick-start
	NOTE: REMOVE built directory BEFORE running 'luarocks install', else
	it will install to the built directory.
3. sudo luarocks install luasocket

(luasocket is required for high resolution gettime)
