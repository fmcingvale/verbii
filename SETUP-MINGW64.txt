Setting up the ports from a fresh mingw-64 installation:

* Go to https://www.msys2.org/ and get the latest installer (msys2-x86_64-YYYYMMDD.exe)
  Follow instructions on website.

	* I just selected 'all' when installing the mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

** The rest of this assumes you are using the 64-bit gcc **

* Start "MSYS MinGW x64" from Start menu

General:
--------

* When starting a fresh shell, cd to verbii root and do "source setup.sh"; this
  sets VERBII_BOOT correctly
  
  * Alternatively, you can set VERBII_BOOT to the location of the lib/ directory
    in the verbii source tree. Make sure to add a trailing / to the path.

* C++:
	
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gc
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
	
	$ cd cpp 
	$ ./setup-mingw.sh
	$ ./make.sh
	
	* Test
	$ cd ../verb 
	$ ../cpp/verbii run-all-tests.verb
	
* Python:

	The base setup already includes Python, so you can run the
	test suite immediately:
	
	$ cd verb 
	$ ../python/verbii run-all-tests.verb
	
* C#:

	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-mono
	$ cd csharp 
	$ ./mono-build.sh
	$ cd ../verb
	$ ../csharp/verbii run-all-tests.verb
	
* Lua:

	Any Lua 5.3.x or 5.4.x should work fine.
	
	If you want/need to build your own, Lua should build fine from source, but extern/lua/README-FIRST.txt is an alternative.

* Chicken:
	
	| This *WORKS* but with two caveats:
	| 	1. verbii has to be run from a normal command prompt, not with the mingw shell
	|		-- stdio appears to get hung up when running under mingw
	|	2. It is very slow compared to linux
		
	* The chicken with mingw conflicts with c# (both compilers are called 'csc'),
	  so I build my own in a unique location.
	  
	$ wget https://code.call-cc.org/releases/5.3.0/chicken-5.3.0.tar.gz
	$ tar zxf chicken-5.3.0.tar.gz
	
	**NOTE** the PREFIX must be an absoluate path *WITH DRIVE LETTER* (per chicken docs)
	So adjust this for the location of msys2 on your system:
	
	$ make PLATFORM=mingw-msys PREFIX=c:/msys2/usr/local/chicken
	$ make PLATFORM=mingw-msys PREFIX=c:/msys2/usr/local/chicken install
	
	$ for name in srfi-13 srfi-34 srfi-1 srfi-69 dyn-vector miscmacros simple-exceptions continuations filepath ; do
		/usr/local/chicken/bin/chicken-install $name ; done
		
	$ cd verbii
	$ source setup.sh 
	$ cd chicken
	$ make
	
	* Test [from NORMAL command prompt, NOT mingw shell]
		$ cd verbii
		$ setupenv.bat
		$ cd verb
		$ ..\chicken\verbii.bat run-all-tests.verb
